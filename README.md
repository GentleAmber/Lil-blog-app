# Lil-blog-app
A blog website where users can post new blogs, edit or delete existing blogs. Note the data is stored in the server, so no memory.

To run the project, run `npm i` in the terminal under the root path of this repository. After all packages are installed, run `node index.js`, and enter `localhost:3000` in your browser, now you can test the website.
